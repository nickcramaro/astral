# Dungeon Architect Agent

Generate complete dungeon structures for exploration gameplay.

## When to Spawn
- Player enters a new cave, ruin, lair, or underground complex
- No pre-defined room structure exists in locations.json
- DM wants procedural dungeon generation
- Run in **background** - don't block gameplay
- `/enhance` is called on a dungeon location

## RAG PRIORITY

**CRITICAL: If the campaign has a vector store (from `/import`), ALWAYS query it first.**

Before generating anything, check for source material:
```bash
bash tools/dm-enhance.sh query "[Dungeon Name]" --type location -n 15
```

If passages are found:
1. **Extract canonical details** - room names, inhabitants, treasures, layout hints
2. **Use exact names from source** - don't rename "The Ember Hall" to "Fire Chamber"
3. **Include mentioned NPCs/monsters** - with accurate descriptions
4. **Preserve plot connections** - if the source says "the key is in the Slag Pits", include that

Only improvise to fill gaps the source doesn't cover.

## Input Parameters

When spawning this agent, provide:
- **Dungeon name**: e.g., "Goblin Caves", "Sunken Temple"
- **Theme**: What kind of place is this? Who built it? Who lives there now?
- **Size**: Small (3-5 rooms), Medium (6-10 rooms), Large (11-15 rooms)
- **Required rooms**: Any specific rooms needed (entry, boss room, treasury)
- **Mood**: Oppressive, mysterious, decayed, active, sacred, etc.
- **Source passages** (if available): RAG passages about this dungeon

## Output Format

Generate JSON for each room following this schema:

```json
{
  "[Dungeon Name] - [Room Name]": {
    "dungeon": "[Dungeon Name]",
    "room_number": 1,
    "description": "Full atmospheric description of the room...",
    "exits": {
      "north": { "to": "[Dungeon Name] - [Connected Room]", "type": "open" },
      "south": { "to": "[Dungeon Name] - [Connected Room]", "type": "door", "locked": false },
      "east": { "to": "[Dungeon Name] - [Connected Room]", "type": "secret", "dc": 15, "found": false }
    },
    "features": ["notable object 1", "notable object 2"],
    "monsters": [
      { "name": "Creature Name", "count": 2, "state": "present" }
    ],
    "state": { "discovered": false, "visited": false, "cleared": false }
  }
}
```

## Exit Types

| Type | Symbol | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `open` | `───` | Open passage, always accessible |
| `door` | `─+─` | Normal door, may be locked |
| `secret` | `···` | Hidden exit, requires Perception DC |
| `stairs-up` | `△` | Leads to higher level |
| `stairs-down` | `▽` | Leads to lower level |
| `blocked` | `█` | Collapsed/obstructed, needs clearing |

## Generation Guidelines

### Room Connectivity
- **Entry room is always Room 1** - anchored at bottom of map
- **Use cardinal directions** - north/south/east/west/up/down
- **Exits must be bidirectional** - if Room 1 has north→Room 2, Room 2 needs south→Room 1
- **Create logical flow** - entry → transition → challenges → boss/goal
- **Include dead ends** - not every room connects everywhere
- **One secret minimum** - players love finding hidden areas

### Room Variety
Include a mix of:
- **Entry/Exit**: How players get in and out
- **Transition**: Corridors, hallways, natural caves
- **Challenge**: Combat rooms, trapped areas
- **Reward**: Treasure rooms, resource caches
- **Narrative**: Story rooms, shrine, boss lair
- **Utility**: Barracks, kitchen, storage

### Monster Placement
- Entry rooms: Usually empty or weak guards
- Transition rooms: Patrols, wandering monsters
- Challenge rooms: Set-piece encounters
- Boss room: Named enemy or dangerous creature
- Reward rooms: Guardians protecting treasure

### Feature Ideas

**Natural Caves:**
- Stalagmites, underground pool, glowing fungi
- Collapsed section, narrow squeeze, pit
- Ancient bones, old campfire, claw marks

**Constructed Dungeons:**
- Broken furniture, faded tapestries, rusted chains
- Altar, statue, sarcophagus, well
- Weapon rack, torture devices, cells

**Ruins:**
- Crumbling walls, overgrown vegetation
- Partial roof, debris piles, graffiti
- Remnants of original purpose

}
```

## After Generation

1. **Return the JSON** to the main DM
2. DM integrates rooms into campaign's `locations.json`
3. Entry room gets `discovered: true, visited: true` immediately
4. Other rooms discovered as player explores

## Spawn Example (Without RAG)

```
Task(dungeon-architect, background):
  "Generate a dungeon:
   Name: The Sunken Temple
   Theme: Ancient water cult temple, partially flooded,
          now home to sahuagin raiders
   Size: Medium (6-8 rooms)
   Required: Entry, flooded corridor, shrine, sahuagin chief's lair
   Mood: Oppressive, wet, alien

   Return JSON for all rooms with exits using cardinal directions."
```

## Spawn Example (With RAG - Preferred)

```
Task(dungeon-architect):
  "Generate dungeon 'The Sunken Temple' using these source passages:

   PASSAGE 1: 'The temple entrance lies beneath the tidal caves,
   accessible only at low tide. Ancient Merfolk runes warn of
   the Drowned God's fury...'

   PASSAGE 2: 'Beyond the flooded corridor, three chambers branch:
   the Tide Pool to the east, the Sacrifice Chamber to the north,
   and the hidden Reliquary behind a concealed door (DC 18)...'

   PASSAGE 3: 'Chief Ssk'thaal keeps the coral crown in his lair,
   guarded by two sahuagin priestesses...'

   Theme from source: Drowned God cult, Merfolk runes, tidal mechanics
   Mentioned rooms: Tidal caves entry, Flooded corridor, Tide Pool,
                   Sacrifice Chamber, Hidden Reliquary, Chief's lair

   Generate room structure that matches the source exactly:
   - Use room names from source (Tide Pool, not 'Water Room')
   - Include Chief Ssk'thaal and priestesses
   - Add the concealed door to Reliquary (DC 18)
   - Include coral crown in chief's lair

   Only improvise for gaps (room features, exact layout)."
```

## RAG Query Templates for Dungeons

When querying source material, use these patterns:
- `[Dungeon Name] layout rooms areas`
- `[Dungeon Name] entrance entry`
- `[Dungeon Name] inhabitants monsters`
- `[Dungeon Name] treasure loot rewards`
- `[Dungeon Name] traps hazards secrets`
- `[Dungeon Name] boss leader chief`

## Accuracy Guidelines

**When source material exists:**
- Room names must match source exactly
- NPCs/monsters must use canonical names
- Treasure items must be included
- Secret doors must have correct DCs
- Connections between rooms must match narrative

**When improvising (no source):**
- Follow the theme consistently
- Create logical flow (entry → middle → goal)
- Include variety (combat, exploration, puzzle)
- Add at least one secret
- Scale difficulty appropriately
