checks that rely on sight.

6 (1 d6 + 3) slashing damage.

that it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution 
saving throw against this magic or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. 

Weird Insight. The nothic chooses one creature within 30 feet of it 
that it can see. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception)

secrets they couldn’t fathom. Though gifted with strange 
cosmic insight that allows them to extract knowledge from 



other creatures, nothics are no longer the wizards they 
once were and have no memories of their previous lives.

at least 10 hit points. Each new jelly has hit points equal to half
