Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6). The dragon breathes poisonous 
gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 

16 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Thoroughly evil, green dragons delight in subverting 
and corrupting the good-hearted. They prefer to dwell in 
ancient forests.
