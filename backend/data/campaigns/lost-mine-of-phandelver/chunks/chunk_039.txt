Lost Mine of Phandelver is divided into four parts. In part 
1, “Goblin Arrows,” the adventurers are on the road to 
the town of Phandalin when they stumble into a goblin 
ambush. They discover that the goblins (who belong to the 
Cragmaw tribe) have captured their dwarf friend Gundren 
Rockseeker and his escort, a human warrior named Sildar 
Hallwinter. The characters must deal with the ambushers 
and then follow their trail back to the goblins’ hideout. 

They rescue Sildar and learn from him that Gundren 
and his brothers discovered a famous lost mine. Sildar 
knows only that Gundren and his map have been taken to 
somewhere called “Cragmaw Castle.” 

In part 2, “Phandalin,” the characters arrive in 
Phandalin to find it terrorized by the Redbrands, a gang

INTRODUCTION 


of miscreants led by a mysterious figure called Glasstaff. 

A number of interesting NPCs can also be found in 
Phandalin, laying the hooks for short adventures in part 
3. The Redbrands try to run the characters out of town, so 
the characters return the favor and storm the Redbrand 
lair. In a hidden stronghold beneath an old manor, they 
find that Iarno “Glasstaff” Albrek, the leader of the 
Redbrands, is taking his orders from someone called 
the Black Spider and that the Black Spider wants the 
adventurers out of the picture. 

Part 3, “The Spider’s Web,” provides the characters 
with several short adventures in the region around 
Phandalin as they search for more information about the 
Black Spider and the dwarves’ lost mine. The clues the 
characters picked up in Phandalin can lead them to spy on 
a mysterious wizard at the ruins of Old Owl Well, seek the 
advice of a dangerous banshee, oust a band of ores lurking 
at Wyvern Tor, and investigate the ruins of the town 
of Thundertree. 

Several of these leads point to Cragmaw Castle, which 
is the stronghold of King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw 
goblins. Here the characters discover that the Black 
Spider is a drow adventurer named Nezznar, and that the 
Cragmaw goblins work for him (drow are elves who hail 
from a realm deep underground). More importantly, they 
recover Gundren Rockseeker’s map to the lost mine, or 
learn the mine’s location from one of the other leads they 
unearth during part 3. 

Following the map or the directions to the lost mine 
brings the characters to part 4, “Wave Echo Cave.” That 
lost underground complex is now overrun by undead and 
strange monsters. Nezznar the Black Spider is there with 
his loyal followers, exploring the mines and searching for 
the legendary Forge of Spells. The adventurers have the 
opportunity to avenge Gundren Rockseeker, to ensure 
the prosperity and security of Phandalin by clearing 
the rich mine of its monsters, and to put an end to the 
troublemaking of the Black Spider— if they can survive the 
dangers of the Lost Mine of Phandelver.
