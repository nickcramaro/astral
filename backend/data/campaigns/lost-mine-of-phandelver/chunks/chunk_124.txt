on a success.

beetles, they thrive in places rank with decay and death.

Spider Climb. The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including 
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. 

Web Sense. While in contact with a web, the spider knows the 
exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web. 


Web Walker. The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by 
webbing of any sort. 

Actions 

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 

Hit: 7 (1 d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 
11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the 
poison reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but 
poisoned for 1 hour, and paralyzed while poisoned in this way. 

Web (Recharge 5-6). Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30 
ft./60 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. 

As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength 
check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can 
also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerable to fire 
damage; immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
