A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in 
a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, 
you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell 
without having to provide any of the spell’s components. 
Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. 

If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher 
level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability 
check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether 
you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s 
level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the 
scroll with no other effect. 

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and 
the scroll itself crumbles to dust.APPENDIX A:
