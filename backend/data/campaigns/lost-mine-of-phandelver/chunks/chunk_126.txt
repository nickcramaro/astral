MONSTERS 


Actions 

Multiattack. The grick makes one attack with its tentacles. If that 
attack hits, the grick can make one beak attack against the same 
target. 

Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage. 

Beak. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 
5 (ld6 + 2) piercing damage. 

The wormlike grick blends in with the stonework of its 
lair. Only when prey comes near does it rear up, its four 
tentacles unfurling to reveal a hungry, snapping beak.

often found in the company of goblins and bugbears. 

Mormesk the Wraith

Incorporeal Movement. The wraith can move through an object or 
another creature, but can’t stop there. 


Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the wraith has 
disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
that rely on sight. 

Actions 

Life Drain. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
creature. Hit: 16 (3d8 + 3) necrotic damage, and the target must 
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point 
maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. If 
this attack reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target 
dies. This reduction to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until 
the target finishes a long rest. 

A wraith is the incorporeal remnant of a particularly 
hateful being. Most wraiths can transform those they have 
slain into spectral undead servitors. Mormesk chooses not 
to, preferring to let the dead stay dead.
