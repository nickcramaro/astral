Actions 

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 
(1 d4 — 1) piercing damage. 

Eye Rays. The spectator uses two of the following eye rays. It can 
use each ray only once per turn. Each ray targets a creature the 
spectator can see within 90 feet of it. 

1. Confusion Ray . The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom 
saving throw, or it can't take reactions until the end of its next 
turn. On its turn, the target can’t move, and it uses its action to 
make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly determined 
creature within range. If the target can’t attack, it does nothing 
on its turn. 

2. Paralyzing Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The 
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect early on a success. 

3. Fear Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving 
throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the 
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if 
the spectator is visible to the target, ending the effect early on a 
success. 

4. Wounding Ray. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution 
saving throw, taking 16 (3dl0) necrotic damage on a failed save, 
or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Create Food and Water. The spectator creates enough food and 
water to sustain itself for 24 hours.
