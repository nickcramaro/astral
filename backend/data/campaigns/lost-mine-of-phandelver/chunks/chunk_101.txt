Booming Waves 

All good dungeons have characteristics that make them unique, 
and Wave Echo Cave is no exception. The rhythmic thunder of 
pounding waves echoes throughout the mine, loud enough 
to make the stone underfoot shiver. Waves come about two 
minutes apart, growing louder toward the northeast. 

Wave Echo Cave is nowhere near the ocean, but a water-filled 
cavern deep in the mine is connected to an underground hot 
spring. That spring boils over continuously to produce a surge 
that slams into a narrow funnel, making a sound like breaking 
surf. Describe this sound to players on occasion. It wili pique 
their curiosity and lure them toward its source, drawing them 
deeper into the mine as a consequence. 



1. Gave Entrance 


Whether the characters follow Gundren’s map or receive 
directions to Wave Echo Cave from another source, their 
initial approach leads them to a narrow tunnel whose 
entrance is hidden within the Sword Mountain foothills. 

The entrance tunnel leads into a large cavern supported by a 
natural pillar of rock and containing three stalagmites. In the 
western part of the cave, behind the column of rock, are three 
bedrolls and a heap of ordinary supplies — sacks of flour, 
bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, 
pickaxes, shovels, and other gear. Amid the supplies, you see 
the body of a dwarf miner, dead for at least a week. 

The northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, 
forming a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit. A sturdy hemp 
rope is tied off around a nearby stalagmite and dangles down 
the side of the pit, at the bottom of which is a rough-hewn 
tunnel heading northwest and east. 

This was the campsite of the Rockseekers. The dead 
dwarf is Tharden, Gundren’s brother, who was killed 
by the Black Spider. Gundren’s other brother, Nundro, 
was here as well and is currently the Black Spider’s 
prisoner in area 20. 

The dwarves’ supplies are potentially useful, but not 
particularly valuable.
