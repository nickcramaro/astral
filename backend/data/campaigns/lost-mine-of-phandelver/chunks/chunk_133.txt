Spell Reflection. If the spectator makes a successful saving throw 
against a spell, or a spell misses it, the spectator can choose 
another creature within 30 feet of it that it can see. The spell 
affects the chosen creature instead of the spectator. 

A spectator is a spherical monster that can be tasked with 
guarding a treasure for a period not exceeding 101 years. 

If the treasure is stolen or destroyed before the spectator’s 
period of service has ended, the creature returns to its 
home dimension. Otherwise, it never abandons its post.

hit points due to blood loss. 

The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. 
It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood from the target orAPPENDIX B:
