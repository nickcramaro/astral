Pit. Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the 
goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet 
deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it. The 
character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically 
if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or 
higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 
15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If 
the trap isn’t detected, the lead character must succeed 
on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking ld6 
bludgeoning damage. The pit’s walls are not steep, so no 
ability check is required to scramble out. 

Awarding Experience Points 

Defeating the goblin ambushers and finding the Cragmaw 
hideout completes a story milestone. When the party 
arrives at the hideout, award each character 75 XP. Make 
sure the players record this gain on their character sheets. 

Cragmaw Hideout 

The Cragmaw tribe of goblins has established a hideout 
from which it can easily harass and plunder traffic moving 
along the Triboar Trail or the path to Phandalin. The 
Cragmaw tribe is so named because each member of the 
tribe sharpens its teeth so they appear fierce and jagged. 

The leader of the Cragmaw bandits lairing here is a 
bugbear named Klarg, who has orders from the chief of 
the Cragmaws to plunder any poorly defended caravans or 
travelers that come this way. A few days ago, a messenger 
from Cragmaw Castle brought new instructions: Waylay the 
dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone traveling with him.PARTI:
