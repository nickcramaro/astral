Introduction 


This book is written for the Dungeon Master. It contains 
a complete Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure, as well 
as descriptions for every creature and magic item that 
appears in the adventure. It also introduces the world of 
the Forgotten Realms, one of the game’s most enduring 
settings, and it teaches you how to run a D&amp;D game. 

The smaller book that accompanies this one (hereafter 
called “the rulebook”) contains the rules you need to 
adjudicate situations that arise during the adventure. 

Running the Adventure 

Lost Mine of Phandelver is an adventure for four to five 
characters of 1st level. During the course of the adventure, 
the characters will advance to 5th level. The adventure 
is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the 
Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms setting. The 
Sword Coast is part of the North— a vast realm of free 
settlements surrounded by wilderness and adventure. 

You don’t need to be a Forgotten Realms expert to run the 
adventure; everything you need to know about the setting 
is contained in this book. 

If this is your first time running a D&amp;D adventure, read 
“The Dungeon Master” section; it will help you better 
understand your role and responsibilities. 

The “Background” section tells you everything you need 
to know to set up the adventure. The “Overview section 
describes how the adventure is expected to run and gives 
you a broad sense of what the player characters should be 
doing at any given time. 

The Dungeon Master 

The Dungeon Master (DM) has a special role in the 
Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. 

The DM is a referee. When it’s not clear what ought to 
happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and 
keep the story going.
