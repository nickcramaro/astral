Shapechanger. The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph 
into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its 
natural form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same 
in each form. Its equipment is not transformed. If slain, the 
doppelganger reverts to its natural form. 

Ambusher. The doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls 
against any creature it has surprised. 

Surprise Attack. If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits 
it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes 
an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack. 

Actions 

Multiattack. The doppelganger makes two melee attacks. 

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 

7 (ld6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. 

Read Thoughts. The doppelganger magically reads the surface 
thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can 
penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 

2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the 
target is within range, the doppelganger can continue reading 
its thoughts as long as the doppelganger’s concentration isn't 
broken. While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has 
advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, 
Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target. 

Doppelgangers take on the appearance of other 
humanoids, throwing off pursuit or luring victims to their 
doom with misdirection and disguise.
