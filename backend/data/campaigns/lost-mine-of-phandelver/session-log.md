Session 1: Saul ambushed by goblins at dead horses on Triboar Trail. Killed one with Hellish Rebuke but was dropped by arrows while fleeing. Goblins stole Gundren's wagon. Saul stabilized and woke hours later, badly wounded, at the ambush site. Wagon gone, goblin trail leads north, Phandalin lies south.
